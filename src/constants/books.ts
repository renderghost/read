			'Kafka’s short story about the construction of the Great Wall of China reveals how human efforts, no matter how monumental, can be both enabled and restricted by rigid systems and hierarchies. Visions of monumental change often masks the small, crucial details that define success or failure.\n\nBy reflecting on how those in power shape ambition, it prompts us to consider the ethical complexities in everything we build and facilitate with our labour. In design, paying attention to both lofty visions and the actual, day-to-day realities faced by end users in their real lives is vital.\n\nThis narrative highlights the tension between grand ideas and practical implementation. For changemakers, appreciating these complexities fosters more equitable solutions and ensures that the human element remains central to the design process.',
